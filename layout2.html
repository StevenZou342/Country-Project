	 <p style="border: 2px solid white;">Located right at the border with Austria, it’s actually easier to get here from Vienna than from Budapest, but no matter where you are coming from, the city is definitely worth a trip.

The Old Town of Sopron might be small but it’s the prettiest with cobbled streets and beautiful houses. When wandering around, you will find various architectural styles, from Roman Empire to Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque structures.

The biggest attraction of Sopron is the Firewatch Tower from where you can admire a beautiful panorama of the city. In Sopron, you can also find important remnants of the Jewish community that used to live here, including two synagogues from the 13th and 14th centuries.</p>

	<h1>Pecs</h1>
	 <img style="width:500px" style="height:600px;" src="https://www.mywanderlust.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/places-to-visit-in-hungary-54.jpg">
	 <p style="border: 2px solid  white;"> Pecs is one of the most interesting places to visit in Hungary, with numerous attractions including the UNESCO-listed ancient necropolis. The city has a long and turbulent history, dating back to the 2nd century, and you can see it reflected in the impressive monuments.

In Pecs you can find one of the most spectacular cathedrals in Hungary, the former mosque converted into a Catholic church, a beautiful synagogue, or some really impressive buildings surrounding the main square, Széchenyi tér.

But Pecs is more than just its monuments. The city has this cool, vibrant yet laid-back atmosphere that is so easy to enjoy.</p>

	<h1>Szeged</h1>
	 <img style="width:500px" style="height:600px;"src="https://www.mywanderlust.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/places-to-visit-in-hungary-46.jpg">
	<p style="border: 2px solid  white;">Szeged is known as the art-nouveau gem of Hungary and this title is very accurate. The city is packed with stunning architecture in that style, you will find it all over the center.

Numerous palaces that used to belong to the noble families (and were named after them) were designed in this style but the two most impressive art-nouveau buildings in Szeged are the town hall from 1883 and the synagogue from the very beginning of the 20th century. It is one of the most stunning synagogues you will ever see, a true architecture masterpiece, both from the outside and inside, a peculiar mix of Art Nouveau and Moorish Revival styles.

Besides the art-nouveau architecture, Szeged is also home to one of the largest churches in Hungary, the Votive Church (Cathedral of Our Lady of Hungary) dominating the centrally located Dóm square.

With the numerous monuments, Szeged is a pleasant city to wander around and enjoy the Central-European atmosphere.

	<h1>Eger</h1>
	<img style="width:500px" style="height:600px;" src="https://www.mywanderlust.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/places-to-visit-in-hungary-57.jpg">
	<p style="border: 2px solid  white;">Eger, a small town located in the north of Hungary, is just packed with attractions. Even if it is a popular day trip from Budapest, it’s worth staying there overnight, enjoying the place when most of the tourists are gone.

The main attraction of Eger is the 13th-century castle, towering on the hill above the city. Inside you can visit the museum telling the story of the castle and the town or go to the undergrounds but the main reason to go to the place is to see the beautiful panorama of Eger from above.

One of the most unique places in Eger is the minaret, the north-most located Turkish monument and the only remnant of the mosque that used to stand here. You can climb the very narrow staircase of the minaret (which itself is a thrilling experience) to see the town from the very narrow balcony.

Eger is also home to numerous impressive churches, including the Minorite Church considered the most beautiful Baroque building in Hungary.

Just outside of Eger you will find “Valley of the beautiful women”, known as one of the best wine regions in Hungary.p>

	<h1>Miskolc</h1>
	<img style="width:500px" style="height:600px;" src="https://www.mywanderlust.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/places-to-visit-in-hungary-32.jpg">
	<p style="border: 2px solid  white;">Even if Miskolc doesn’t have all that many monuments, it’s still worth stopping in the city when you are exploring northern Hungary.

The area of Miskolc was inhabited already in BC times and since the 15th century, it was the royal town, later under Turkish rule. Since it was largely destroyed during WW2 and then went through major industrialization, only a few interesting buildings remained today.

The main street, Széchenyi st., is a picturesque long avenue with beautiful architecture. But the top attractions in Miskolc are its numerous churches, in different styles, and of various religions.

Most tourists who visit Miskolc come here to enjoy the cave bath located in the Miskolctapolca area of the city. Miskolc is also a good base or starting point to explore the beautiful Bükk Mountains surrounding the city.</p>

  <img style="width:500px; height:400px;" src="https://www.mywanderlust.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/places-to-visit-in-hungary-33.jpg">
  <p style="border: 2px solid  white;">One of the most interesting places at the Lake Balaton shore is Keszthely, located at the western tip of the lake. The town has a long, a few hundred years, history which can be seen in the variety of architectural styles displayed in the buildings of Keszthely.

The biggest attraction of the city is the stunning and impressive Festetics Palace from the 18th century, one of the largest buildings of that kind in Hungary. Today the palace is home to the museum but you can find more attractions on the estate and wander around the pleasant gardens.

The lakeside promenade is another fine place for a stroll as is the center of the town with numerous monuments and attractions.</p>
